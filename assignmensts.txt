1. *Create a function* that takes an array, an index, and a value as parameters. Inside the function, use the insert method to insert the value at 
the specified index in the array. Return the modified array.

2. *Implement a simple shopping cart program* using an array. Create functions to add items, remove items, and update quantities using array methods. 
Print the cart's contents after each operation.

3. *Write a program* that uses a while loop to print the first 25 integers.
